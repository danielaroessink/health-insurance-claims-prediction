# Predictive Analytics for Insurance claims

## Project overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of an insurance claim being filed based on customer demographics, policy details and past claims.
The goal is to deliver actionable insights and a predictive model that can help insurance companies make informed decisions about their customer base and policy offerings.

## Objectives
1. **Data Preparation:** Clean and structure the dataset to ensure high-quality input for the model
2. **Feature engineering:** Analyse and create features to improve model perfomance
3. **Model development:** Build and evaluate a classification model to predict the likelihood of an insurance claim
4. **Insights and Visualisation:** Extract and present insights through visualisation and feature importance analysis
